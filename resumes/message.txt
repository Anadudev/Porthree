6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
mandatory
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
The two digits must be different
01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
Print only the smallest combination of two digits
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
The last number should be followed by a new line
You can only use no more than 3 print functions with string format
You can only use no more than 2 loops in your code
You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
You are not allowed to import any module
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./6-print_comb3.py
01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 56, 57, 58, 59, 67, 68, 69, 78, 79, 89

7. Insert at index
mandatory
Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
Prototype: dlistint_t *insert_dnodeint_at_index(dlistint_t **h, unsigned int idx, int n);
where idx is the index of the list where the new node should be added. Index starts at 0
Returns: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
if it is not possible to add the new node at index idx, do not add the new node and return NULL
Your files 2-add_dnodeint.c and 3-add_dnodeint_end.c will be compiled during the correctio

7. Integer validator
mandatory
Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).
Public instance method: def area(self): that raises an Exception with the message area() is not implemented
Public instance method: def integer_validator(self, name, value): that validates value:
you can assume name is always a string
if value is not an integer: raise a TypeError exception, with the message <name> must be an integer
if value is less or equal to 0: raise a ValueError exception with the message <name> must be greater than 0
You are not allowed to import any module
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0A$ cat 7-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
BaseGeometry = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry

bg = BaseGeometry()

bg.integer_validator("my_int", 12)
bg.integer_validator("width", 89)

try:
    bg.integer_validator("name", "John")
except Exception as e:
    print("[{}] {}".format(e.__class__.__name__, e))

try:
    bg.integer_validator("age", 0)
except Exception as e:
    print("[{}] {}".format(e.__class__.__name__, e))

try:
    bg.integer_validator("distance", -4)
except Exception as e:
    print("[{}] {}".format(e.__class__.__name__, e))

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0A$ ./7-main.py
[TypeError] name must be an integer
[ValueError] age must be greater than 0
[ValueError] distance must be greater than 0

Hello @channel
Most of you might have been experiencing issues with circular imports (modules trying to import each other in a cyclic or mutually dependent manner).
I'd recommend going through this resource that goes into detail on what they are, how to solve them and a few comprehensible examples.
